## About the event

We welcome you to a full day workshop on Modern Developer Experience on Wednesday 14th of May 2025 in Oulu!

Gone are the days when knowing one programming language was enough for a developer. Now developers are juggling different front-end frameworks, back-end programming languages, cloud services and APIs while at the same time navigating the ever-evolving security threat landscape. With a serious shortage of developers, the pressure to keep up with the speed demanded by businesses is ever increasing.

Join us for a full day workshop on how modern AWS developer tools, particularly Amazon Q Developer, are transforming the development landscape. Discover the full power of Amazon Q Developer through out your entire software development lifecycle, from planning to maintenance and modernization.

Beyond Amazon Q, we'll dive into complementary AWS developer tools to give you a full understanding on the best tools around topics like application security, IaC and CI/CD.

If this sounds interesting to you then sign up and join us to learn more about Modern developer experience on AWS! AWS provides you sandbox accounts, instructions and a local team of experts to support you throughout the day.

## Who is this event for?

This event is for anyone with computer skills regardless of your AWS knowledge level. Developers, engineers and administrators can use this Immersion Day to start familiarizing themselves with AWS technologies and services.
